# README

Much numerical computing relies heavily on linear algebra.  

I believe that "only masochists implement linear algebra themselves", or OMILAT.

If we sound that out like the egg dish, it's easy to remember.

This repository contains resources to guide students as they tinker, test, reflect, rebuild, and retest their code to compute dot products, matrix-vector products, and matrix-matrix products.  Along the way, we'll rope in CMake, various BLAS and LAPACK libraries, OpenMP, and CUDA.
